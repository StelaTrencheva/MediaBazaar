# Media Bazaar - WFA + PHP web application
Semester 2 Group Project

## Description
### 1. Project background
A new hardware store “Media Bazaar” is opening their first shop in Eindhoven. Funded
by the parent company “Jupiter”, they intend to start as well prepared as possible. They
have been facing problems with managing and tracking employees and stock and their
priority is on these points, but employees’ administration is even more important. These
problems are due to the fact that they are doing everything manually at the moment.
They are using online calendars and excel sheets, but they found them too detailed and
unreliable. That is why they need a team of software developers to build a brand new
application for them.
There are competitors working on similar solution and after the first phase of the project
(week 6) the client is going to decide if the team is going to continue working on it. That
is why the team should strive for delivering a solution that best suits the need of the client
